    # seems the sniff gets confused with the "magic" happening in Config::has() function
    # unfortunately I can't disable sniffs per function, so I have to exclude the only relevant class for this sniff
    # however this should (hopefully) be fixed with v2.0, where get() and has() are not redundant anymore
